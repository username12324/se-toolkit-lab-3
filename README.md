# Lab 2 — Understand, improve, and deploy a back end service

Questions:

- Do you know what skills are needed to build software projects?
- Have you thought about which tech role you want to pursue as your career?

In this lab, you will explore three things:

1. How real software products may be structured;
2. What kind of engineers may build and operate them;
3. How your skills compare to market demands.

You'll also practice using `Git` and `GitHub`. These tools are essential for:

- collaboration between developers;
- incremental and iterative improvement of the code base.

## Learning advice

You need to read the lab tasks and docs to understand them. Do what you can by yourself.

When stuck or unsure, feel free to ask an LLM:

> Give me directions on how to solve this task. I want to maximize learning.

You can also ask LLMs to explain the logic behind tasks if you don't understand it. Example:

> Why is this task important? What exactly do they want to teach me?

Remember: Use LLMs as a tool to enhance your understanding, not replace it.

Always critically evaluate the information provided by LLMs.

Verify this information against credible sources such as official documentation, course materials, and what you observe in reality.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this lab, you should be able to:

- Use `Git` and `GitHub` to structure your work and collaborate with peers (commits with clear messages, branches, issues, pull requests, and reviews).
- Check your work against specified acceptance criteria.
- Explain the basic architecture of a real-world digital product in terms of components, data flow, deployment, and tech roles.
- Reflect on your career in tech, examine your current skillset, and plan for the future.

After this lab, you should be able to say:

> I can use `Git` and `GitHub`.
>
> I understand how software products can be structured.
>
> I know how I can grow as an IT specialist.

## Tasks

### Setup (~30 min)

First complete the [lab setup](./lab/setup.md).

### Required tasks (~2 hours)

For all required tasks, you must follow the same [`Git workflow`](./lab/tasks/git-workflow.md).

1. [Practice the `Git workflow`](./lab/tasks/required/task-0.md#practice-the-git-workflow) (~15 min)
2. [Choose a product and study its architecture](./lab/tasks/required/task-1.md#choose-a-product-and-study-its-architecture) (~30 min)
3. [Study tech roles involved in the chosen product](./lab/tasks/required/task-2.md#study-tech-roles-involved-in-the-chosen-product) (~30 min)
4. [Compare your tech skills with the market needs](./lab/tasks/required/task-3.md#compare-your-tech-skills-with-the-market-needs) (~30 min)

### Optional tasks

Complete all optional tasks to leave up to 1 hour early (lab is 3 hours):

1. [Resolve a merge conflict](./lab/tasks/optional/task-1.md#resolve-a-merge-conflict).
2. [Add a CI check](./lab/tasks/optional/task-2.md#add-a-ci-check)
3. [Create a release](./lab/tasks/optional/task-3.md#create-a-release)
4. [Plan skill development](./lab/tasks/optional/task-4.md#plan-skill-development)
