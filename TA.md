# Instructions for TAs

## Grading

Points are given as follows:

<!-- TODO provide a weight for each task -->

## Process

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> There are 30 students and they'll presumably start submitting their works in the last two hours of the lab.
>
> A TA has only approximately 4 minutes for each student.

- There's a table where:
  - each student provides:
    - their GitHub username;
    - collaborator's GitHub username;
    - links to task issues;
    - statuses of tasks.
  - TA marks accepted tasks.

- TA walks around the class and tracks progress for tasks in that table.

- Student:
  - completes one or more tasks;
  - marks in the table that these tasks are waiting for a TA's review;
  - raises a hand to call the TA.

- TA:
  - comes to the student;
  - answers questions, if any;
  - checks tasks using the [Checklist for TA](#checklist-for-ta);
  - asks additional questions to check student's understanding (remember the time limit for each student);
  - suggests improvements;
  - marks the task as accepted in the table when the task is complete.

- After the lab, [automated checks](#automated-checks) will run.
